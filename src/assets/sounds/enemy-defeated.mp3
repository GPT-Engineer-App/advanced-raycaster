Unfortunately, I can't create or upload binary files such as MP3s. However, I can guide you on how to add a sound effect file named "enemy-defeated.mp3" to your project.

1. **Create the Directory Structure**:
   Ensure you have the following directory structure in your project:
   ```
   src/
   └── assets/
       └── sounds/
   ```

2. **Obtain the Sound File**:
   You need to obtain or create an MP3 file named "enemy-defeated.mp3". You can either create this sound effect yourself using audio editing software or download a free sound effect from a website that offers royalty-free sounds.

3. **Add the File to Your Project**:
   Once you have the "enemy-defeated.mp3" file, place it in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure
If you don't already have the directories, create them using your terminal or file explorer.

**Using Terminal (Linux/MacOS):**
```sh
mkdir -p src/assets/sounds
```

**Using Command Prompt (Windows):**
```sh
mkdir src\assets\sounds
```

### Step 2: Obtain the Sound File
You can find free sound effects on websites like:
- [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
- [SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/)

Search for a sound effect that fits the "enemy defeated" theme, download it, and rename it to "enemy-defeated.mp3" if necessary.

### Step 3: Add the File to Your Project
Move or copy the downloaded "enemy-defeated.mp3" file to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

### Example:
After following these steps, your project structure should look like this:
```
your-project/
├── src/
│   └── assets/
│       └── sounds/
│           └── enemy-defeated.mp3
```

Now, you can reference this sound file in your code to play it when an enemy is defeated. For example, in JavaScript, you might use:
```javascript
const enemyDefeatedSound = new Audio('src/assets/sounds/enemy-defeated.mp3');
enemyDefeatedSound.play();
```

This is how you can implement the "enemy-defeated.mp3" sound effect in your project.
