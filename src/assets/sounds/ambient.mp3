Unfortunately, I can't create or upload audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to add an ambient sound file named "ambient.mp3" to the `assets/sounds` directory in your project.

1. **Create the Directory Structure**:
   Ensure you have the following directory structure in your project:
   ```
   your-project/
   └── src/
       └── assets/
           └── sounds/
   ```

2. **Add the Ambient Sound File**:
   Obtain an ambient sound file in MP3 format. You can either create one yourself or download a royalty-free ambient sound from a website that offers free sound effects, such as freesound.org or similar.

3. **Place the File in the Directory**:
   Once you have the `ambient.mp3` file, place it in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the Directory Structure**:
   Open your terminal or file explorer and navigate to your project directory. Create the necessary directories if they don't already exist:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p src/assets/sounds
   ```

2. **Download or Create the Ambient Sound**:
   - If you are downloading a file, make sure it is in MP3 format.
   - If you are creating your own, use an audio editing tool to save your ambient sound as `ambient.mp3`.

3. **Move the File**:
   Move or copy the `ambient.mp3` file to the `src/assets/sounds/` directory. You can do this using the command line or your file explorer.

   Using the command line:
   ```sh
   mv /path/to/your/downloaded/ambient.mp3 src/assets/sounds/
   ```

   Or simply drag and drop the file using your file explorer.

### Verification

To verify that the file is correctly placed, you can list the contents of the `src/assets/sounds/` directory:
```sh
ls src/assets/sounds/
```

You should see `ambient.mp3` listed.

That's it! You have successfully added the `ambient.mp3` file to the `assets/sounds` directory in your project.
