Unfortunately, I cannot create or upload audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to add a sound effect file named "enemy-hit.mp3" to your project.

1. **Find or Create the Sound Effect:**
   - You can create a sound effect using audio editing software like Audacity.
   - Alternatively, you can find free sound effects on websites like freesound.org or other royalty-free sound libraries.

2. **Save the File:**
   - Once you have the sound effect, save it as "enemy-hit.mp3".

3. **Add to Project:**
   - Place the "enemy-hit.mp3" file in the `src/assets/sounds` directory of your project.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Download or Create the Sound:**
   - If you are downloading, go to a sound library website, search for an appropriate "enemy hit" sound effect, and download it.
   - If you are creating, use your audio editing software to create and export the sound as an MP3 file.

2. **Rename the File:**
   - Ensure the file is named "enemy-hit.mp3".

3. **Move the File:**
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Place the "enemy-hit.mp3" file in the `src/assets/sounds` directory.

Your project structure should look something like this:

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── sounds/
│   │   │   └── enemy-hit.mp3
│   ├── ...
├── ...
```

Once you have the file in place, you can use it in your project as needed. For example, in a JavaScript project, you might load and play the sound like this:

```javascript
const enemyHitSound = new Audio('src/assets/sounds/enemy-hit.mp3');

function playEnemyHitSound() {
    enemyHitSound.play();
}

// Call this function when an enemy is hit
playEnemyHitSound();
```

This is a general guide to help you add the "enemy-hit.mp3" file to your project.
