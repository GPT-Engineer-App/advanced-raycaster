Unfortunately, I can't create or upload audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to add a sound effect file named "shoot.mp3" to your project.

1. **Find a Sound Effect**: You need to find a shooting sound effect. You can search for free sound effects on websites like:
   - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
   - [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
   - [SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/)

2. **Download the Sound Effect**: Once you find a suitable shooting sound effect, download it in MP3 format.

3. **Add to Project Directory**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Create the necessary folders if they don't already exist: `src/assets/sounds/`.
   - Place the downloaded `shoot.mp3` file into the `sounds` directory.

Your project directory structure should look something like this:
```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── sounds/
│   │   │   └── shoot.mp3
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

By following these steps, you will have successfully added the `shoot.mp3` sound effect to your project.
