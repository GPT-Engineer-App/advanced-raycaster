Unfortunately, I can't create or upload audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to add a sound effect file named "move.mp3" to your project.

1. **Obtain the Sound File**: First, you need to have a sound file named "move.mp3". You can either create one using audio editing software or download a free sound effect from a website that offers royalty-free sounds.

2. **Directory Structure**: Ensure that your project has the following directory structure:
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── assets/
   │   │   ├── sounds/
   │   │   │   └── move.mp3
   ```

3. **Add the File**: Place the "move.mp3" file in the `src/assets/sounds/` directory.

If you follow these steps, you will have successfully added the "move.mp3" sound effect to your project.
