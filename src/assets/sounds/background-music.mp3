I'm unable to create or upload audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to add a background music file named "background-music.mp3" to the `assets/sounds` directory in your project.

1. **Obtain the MP3 File:**
   - You need to have an MP3 file that you want to use as background music. You can either create one using audio editing software or download a royalty-free music file from the internet.

2. **Create the Directory Structure:**
   - Ensure that your project has the following directory structure:
     ```
     your-project/
     └── src/
         └── assets/
             └── sounds/
     ```

3. **Add the MP3 File:**
   - Place your `background-music.mp3` file into the `sounds` directory. The path should look like this:
     ```
     your-project/src/assets/sounds/background-music.mp3
     ```

4. **Verify the File:**
   - Make sure the file is correctly named `background-music.mp3` and is in the correct directory.

If you follow these steps, you will have successfully added the `background-music.mp3` file to the `assets/sounds` directory in your project.
